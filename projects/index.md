### Shropshire Devs
I co-run Shropshire Devs which is a web developer user based in Shropshire, UK that meets once at the e-Innovation Centre, Telford. See <a href="https://shropshiredevs.co.uk" target="_blank">ShropshireDevs.co.uk</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/shropshiredevs" target="_blank">@ShropshireDevs</a> for more information.

### SSL Labs .NET Api Wrapper
I authored the first .NET wrapper for the SSL Labs API. This allows .NET developers to easily consume the offerings of the API and run SSL tests from within code. The project is also open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/AshleyPoole/ssllabs-api-wrapper" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
