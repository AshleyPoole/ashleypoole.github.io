Disney has signed an agreement to buy Lucasfilm off George Lucas, who owned 100% of the company for $4.05 billion which is about £2.51 billion give or take a few hundred thousand pounds. As well as Lucasfilm and the Star Wars brand, Disney has also acquired other George Lucas owned companies such as LucasArts as part of this deal.

Star Wars 7 is set for release in 2015 which will be followed by Starts 8 and 9. Disney CEO, Robert A. Iger’s stated to investors today:
<blockquote><em>In 2015, we're planning to release Star Wars Episode 7 – the first feature film under the 'Disney-Lucasfilm' brand. That will be followed by Episodes 8 and 9 – and our long term plan is to release a new Star Wars feature film every two to three years.</em></blockquote>
On the positive side of things, Robert A. Iger's stated that George Lucas will stop on as a creative consultant which should hopefully mean we get another great film that we have come to expect of the Star Wars series.
<blockquote><em>We're very happy that George Lucas will be creative consultant on our new Star Wars films and that Kathleen Kennedy, the current Co-Chair of Lucasfilm, will executive produce.</em></blockquote>
Let's hope Disney can do us proud a<em>s when Star Wars 7 is released, it will have been a <em>decade since the last film was released!</em></em>
