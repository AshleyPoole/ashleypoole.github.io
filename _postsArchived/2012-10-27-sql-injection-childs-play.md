SQL injection is becoming far too easy with the help of such tools as Havij. Havij is marketed as automated SQL injection tool for penetration testing, yet I wonder what % of real world users of this tool actually use it for 'testing'.

Below is a great video I came across from Troy Hunt's Youtube channel demonstrating how easy Havij is to use and how easy it can be to extract data from poorly written and secured sites.
