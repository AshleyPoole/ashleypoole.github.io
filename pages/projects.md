### Shropshire Devs
I co-organise Shropshire Devs, a web and .NET developer user group based in Shropshire, UK. The user groups meets monthly in Telford. See <a href="https://shropshiredevs.co.uk" target="_blank">ShropshireDevs.co.uk</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/shropshiredevs" target="_blank">@ShropshireDevs</a> for more information.

### SSL Labs .NET Api Wrapper
I authored the first .NET wrapper for the SSL Labs API. This allows .NET developers to easily consume the offerings of the API, and run SSL tests from within .NET code. Project documentation including source code can be found my <a href="/ssllabs-api-wrapper" target="_blank">SSL Labs Api Wrapper page</a>.
