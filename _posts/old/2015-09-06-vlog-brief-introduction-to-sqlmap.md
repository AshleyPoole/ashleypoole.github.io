For months now I’ve wanted to giving video blogging a go but have always shied away from it mainly from being too self conscious. While this completely hasn’t gone away, I have managed to pluck up the courage and record my first ever video blog which your about to see below.

So why now? Good question. There are two reasons that are driving me to give vlogging a go now which are:  
1. After recently presenting two sessions on information security to about 50+ engineers at an internal conference last month, I saw vlogging as another format I could utilise to work on my public speaking skills.  
2. One of the two sessions I presented, I had planned on demonstrating SQLMap but unfortunately ran out of time due to technical issues so didn’t get chance to show how easy SQL Injection is using automated tools. As I know a few people really wanted to see this tool in action from the conference, I thought this was a great opportunity to try vlogging out on a topic that people wanted.

### Introducing SqlMap
I’m not going to explain too much here but simply <a href="http://sqlmap.org/" target="_blank">SQLMap</a> is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection.

Enjoy the video! – Yes I was slightly nervous recording this and know my editing skills need improvement too.
