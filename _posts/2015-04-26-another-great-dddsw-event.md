So as I write this, I’m currently heading back from DDDSW6 event yesterday that took place in Bristol, UK. Simply put, I want to say a huge thank you to the DDDSW team for organising such a great event and for the range of topics covered by the speakers; also not forgetting <a title="Sponsors of DDDSW6" href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/dddsw-6-sponsors" target="_blank">the sponsors</a> that make it possible to run this community event which is free for attendees!

For those who don’t know, <a title="About DDDSW" href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/about-us" target="_blank">DDDSW (Developer, Developer, Developer South West)</a> is a yearly community run event for developers hosted in Bristol and this year was their sixth such iteration.

This year I personally attended (and loved!) the following sessions:  

<strong>Mark Rendle - Docker Strangelove, or, How I Defenestrated ASP.NET</strong>  
A demo of using Docker to run ASP.NET 5 applications on Linux and also using Nginx to proxy those request.

<strong>Matt Ellis - .NETCore Blimey!</strong>  
A bleeding edge overview of .NetCore and differences between the .Net Framework as well as where ASP.NET vNext fits into this newly open sourced, cross platform world.

<strong>Joel Hammond-Turner - Logging and Monitoring, How to keep DevOps happy</strong>  
A look into how to easily achieve monitoring and logging, and why this is important for your DevOps team supporting your code and applications in production. Included demonstration of Metrics.Net and Serilog.

<strong>Mauro Servienti - Designing distributed, scalable and reliable systems using NServiceBus</strong>  
Maurco is a solution architect for Particular Software, the makers of NServiceBus, who took us through a jam packed hour session on messaging concepts and how this can simplify the development process. Also included running examples.

<strong>David Ringsell - An introduction to MVC including the benefits and the design pattern</strong>  
A quick introduction to MVC (Model, View, Control) design pattern including a brief example and how these degrees of separation are an important step forward.

Once again, I want to say a big thanks to the DDDSW team and that I'm already looking forward to next years event!! #OneHappyGeek
