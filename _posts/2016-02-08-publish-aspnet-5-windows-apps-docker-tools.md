Now you've heard publishing a ASP.NET 5 / ASP.NET Core website to a Docker container is an easy as 1-2-3 but how easy is it actually in real life? Below I give you a whirlwind tour of creating a new Windows Docker container host and publishing your first application to the Docker container host, all from within Visual Studio! This is a no frills video demo so don't expect any cheesy music or fade-in / fade-out effects, simply a flash demo video for you to follow along.

In order to follow along with this video, you must already have the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0f5b2caa-ea00-41c8-b8a2-058c7da0b3e4" target="_blank">Visual Studio Tools for Docker</a> installed. This recording is based on the Visual Studio Tools for Docker December Preview, Windows Server 2016 technical preview 4 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 1.

This whirlwind video demo will walk you through:  
1. Creating a new Docker host running Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 hosted on Azure  
2. Publishing your web application  
3. Accessing your web application inside your Docker container
