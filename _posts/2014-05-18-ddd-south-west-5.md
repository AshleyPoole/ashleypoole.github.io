230 miles latter and I have arrived home after yesterdays trip to <a title="dddsouthwest.com" href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com" target="_blank">DDDSW</a> conference in Bristol, UK. DDDSW stands for DeveloperDeveloperDevelop South West which is a free conference organised for developers by developers.

This year was the fifth DDDSW conference which also happened to be my first year in attendance. In-short, it was a professionally organised event with great sessions on a multitude of topics which I would fully recommend. Below are the five sessions I selected and attended:
<ol>
	<li>Steve Sanderson - Architecting large single page applications with Knockout.js</li>
	<li>Ashic Mahtab - Complexity =&gt; Simplicity</li>
	<li>Colin Angus Mackay - Introduction to S.O.L.I.D</li>
	<li>Gary Short - Hadoop and Big Data for Microsoft developers</li>
	<li>James Crowley - 10 things I learnt about web application security being pen tested by banks</li>
</ol>
My two favorite sessions were those on Hadoop (4) and Web application security (5) although I did take away newly learnt knowledge from all of the sessions as well as adding a few items to my personal development list.

I would like to end this post with a BIG thank you to all the organises, speakers and sponsors of DDDSW who made it all possible! Already looking forward to DDDSW next year too.
